## Overview

This project contains a PureScript program designed to analyze football data from the English Premier League season 2001/2002. It processes the `football.dat` file to find the team with the smallest difference in 'for' and 'against' goals.

## Getting Started

```
Install dependencies:

```
## Running the Program

Execute the program with:

```bash

```

The name of the team with the smallest difference in goals will be printed to the console.

## Development

The program was developed in three main versions:

-  Version 1.0 - Basic file reading.
